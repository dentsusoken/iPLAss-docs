==== Settings of Lock Timeout
The timeout threshold to wait for a rowlock, the default value is 0(NOWAIT).

■Oracle::
To enable and change the lock timeout threshold, please configure the following item from mtp-service-config.xml and set it to a value larger than 0.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.rdb.adapter.RdbAdapterService</interface>
  <property name="adapter" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.rdb.oracle.OracleRdbAdapter">
    <property name="lockTimeout" value="0" />
  </property>
</service>
----

■MySQL::
MySQL sets the lock timeout threshold in unit of DB, therefore it behaves differently from Oracle DB. For instance, the logic like [select for update nowait] will rise error right after retrieving the lock with Oracle, but the same thing will not happen in MySQL.

■PostgreSQL::
To enable and change the lock timeout threshold,please configure the following item in mtp-service-config.xml and set it to something larger than 0.
PostgreSQL cannot specify the waiting time for the lock. If timeout was set to value larger than 0, the system will wait until acquiring the lock.

==== Oracle's Unique Settings
* About the wildcard in LIKE expressions +
Starting from 11.2.0.3.0, the feature of the wildcard in LIKE expression has changed. +
Since then, full Width ％ and ＿ are not wildcard anymore, they will be perceived as normal character. +
To solve the compatibility issue for older versions due to this changes, we provided a escapeFullwidthWildcard flag in OracleRdbAdapter. +
The default value is false (as 11.2.0.3.0 or higher has no such problem). +
Say, if you are using 11.2.0.2.0, then you should set this flag to true. +

==== MySQL's Unique Settings

* Storage Engine: InnoDB, which require the File Format: Barracuda(with innodb_large_prefix)
+
====
Storage Engine:: InnoDB
File Format:: Barracuda
====
producing you have enabled innodb_large_prefix.

NOTE: For MySQL Version 5.7.7 or higher, the configuration about ``innodb_large_prefix`` is not needed anymore.

* Pleas use [utf8mb4] as the standard character set.
+

+
However, the following restrictions occur when using this character code.

- If "Unique Index" or "Index" is specified in the String property of the Entity, there will be restrictions on the target value size depending on the character code used by MySQL.
- In the case of utf8mb4, if a value exceeding 255 characters is set in the StringProperty value, an error will rise when updating.

+
The character set can be specified as follows in the option file (my.ini / cnf).

[source,ini]
----
[client]
default-character-set=utf8mb4
[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8mb4
[mysqld]
character-set-server=utf8mb4
----

* Disable the query cache +
When query cache is enabled, the table will be locked when writing in.
Updating with time consuming tasks may affect the process form other sessions. So it is necessary to disable query cache.
+
[source,ini]
----
[mysqld]
query_cache_size=0
----

NOTE: For MySQL8.0.1 or higher, this setting is not required anymore.

* Set the storage destination for LOB data +
For MySQL, it is recommended to store LOB data outside RDB. LOB can be stored in the file system, or in the [.eeonly]#AWS S3# storages.
Then it is necessary to change the storage destination, please refer to the part of <<lob_store_dest, LOB Storage Destination>>.

* Using GTID +
To use GTID for group replications, the configuration about temporary table is necessary. +
Under the standard of iPLAss, the temporary tables are created and deleted inside the transactions. However, in the case of GTID, it is impossible to create or delete temporary tables inside the transaction.
Therefore, iPLAss provides the options to perform the creation and deletion of temporary tables outside the transactions, or on the data source side.

+

+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `obj_store_tmp` (`obj_id` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, `obj_ver` BIGINT(10) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL) ENGINE = MEMORY;
----

* Settings of internal temporary table +
Starting from MySQL5.7, the storage engine for the internal temporary table is by default``InnoDB``.
For this reason, when using internal temporary tables, there could be errors because of exceeding size. +
This issue can be avoided by switching the storage engine to ``MyISAM``.
+
[source,ini]
----
[mysqld]
internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=MyISAM
----

NOTE: For MySQL8.0.16 or higher version, this setting is not required.

* Importing Timezone Data +
It is necessary to import timezone data for the system.
For more about importing the timezone, please refer to the MySQL timezone https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/timezones.html[Download Site].

* specifying the timezone +
Connector/J 8.0 or higher require this timezone settings. +
For Windows environment, the system timezone is not employed by MySQL, so it is mandatory to specify the timezone for MySQL. +
For Linux, the system timezone can be utilized by MySQL, therefore there is no need to specify the timezone except changing to a different timezone.
+
There are 3 way to specify the timezone, which are listed below.
+
- Specify by the environment variable [TZ].(recommended) +
Example::
TZ=JST-9

- Specify by the JDBC parameter [serverTimezone].
Example::
jdbc:mysql://<mysqlserver>:3306/mtdb?serverTimezone=Asia%2FTokyo

- Specify by MySQL config files +
The timezone features have to be imported to MySQL beforehand.
Example::
+
[source,ini]
----
[mysqld]
default-time-zone='Asia/Tokyo'
----

IMPORTANT: The specified timezone have to be similar to the timezone of the AP Server.(more accurate:JRE).

* Settings to support window functions +
For MySQL8.0 or higher version, MySQL can use the native window function.
In order to utilize MySQL native Window function feature, the following settings are required.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.rdb.adapter.RdbAdapterService</interface>
  <property name="adapter" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.rdb.mysql.MysqlRdbAdaptor">
    <property name="supportWindowFunction" value="true" />
  </property>
</service>
----
+
To access the window function feature using the version older than MySQL5.7 (which does not support such feature)), please enable the [.eeonly]#Window function emulator mechanics#. +
To enable window function emulator, please perform the following settings.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>

  <property name="dataStore" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.datastore.grdb.EnterpriseGRdbDataStore">
    <property name="enableWindowFunctionEmulation" value="true" />
  </property>
</service>
----

* Settings for using decimal places +
When using the Decimal type as the property type of Entity or the DIV operator in EQL, set the MySQL system variable `div_precision_increment` to the fifth decimal place. +
Even if the Decimal type does not use the DIV operator, it is necessary to set `div_precision_increment` since iPLAss automatically performs DIV to adjust the number of digits internally.

==== PostgreSQL's Unique Settings
* Settings of LOB data storage destination +
For PostgreSQL, it is recommended to store the LOB data outside the RDB system. LOB data can be stored in the file system, or in the [.eeonly]#AWS S3# storages.
To do so, the storage destination should be changed, please refer to the part of <<lob_store_dest, LOB Storage Destination>>.

To make the AP server redundant, it is necessary to configure iPLAss in addition to the cluster setting on the AP server.
iPLAss caches and stores metadata etc. in the memory of the AP server. Therefore it is necessary to share the cached object and make sure they are synchronized over all clusters.
+
The cluster member notification methods can be set to one of the followings.

- HttpMessageChannel +
This will send asynchronous notification to each AP server based on HTTP request. +
For the configure item of ClusterService, set org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.channel.http.HttpMessageChannel.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.ClusterService</interface>
  <property name="messageChannel" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.channel.http.HttpMessageChannel">
    <property name="serverUrl" value="http://1stMechineHOSTName/mtp/cmcs" /> <1>
    <property name="serverUrl" value="http://2ndMechineHOSTName/mtp/cmcs" />
    <property name="certKey" value="yourOwnCertKey" /> <2>
    <property name="connectionTimeout" value="300000" />
    <property name="soTimeout" value="300000" />
  </property>
</service>
----
<1> List and indicate cluster members at serverUrl in the format of ``http://[HOSTName]/[appContext]/cmcs``.
<2> yourOwnCertKey is for you to set the common security secret(such as password) for all the clusters.
+
When utilizing HttpMessageChannel, the asynchronous thread pool size should also be configured. The size is recommended to be twice as the amount of real servers.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service name="AsyncTaskServiceForHttpMessageChannel">
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.async.AsyncTaskService</interface>
  <property name="corePoolSize" value="4" />
  <property name="threadPoolType" value="fixed" />
</service>
----
+
- JGroupsMessageChannel +
Using the JGroups from cluster message utility tools to send the notification messages. +
At ClusterService, specify org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.channel.jgroups.JGroupsMessageChannel.
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.ClusterService</interface>
  <property name="messageChannel" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.channel.jgroups.JGroupsMessageChannel">
    <property name="configFilePath" value="/path/to/jgroups_config_file.xml" />
    <property name="clusterName" value="jgroupsClusterName" />
  </property>
</service>
----
+
JGroups will use the protocol such as multicast and S3_PING to discover the cluster members automatically.
Thus it can be utilized if the number of cluster nodes is unknown, or even if the HOST name is dynamical.

- InfinispanMessageChannel +
Using the Infinispan cluster member notification functions to send the messages. +
At ClusterService, set org.iplass.mtp.impl.infinispan.cluster.channel.InfinispanMessageChannel(producing the InfinispanService itself was configured already.)。
+
[source,xml]
----
<service>
  <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.cluster.ClusterService</interface>
  <property name="messageChannel" class="org.iplass.mtp.impl.infinispan.cluster.channel.InfinispanMessageChannel">
    <property name="sync" value="false" />
  </property>
</service>
----
+
Beware that Infinispan is using JGroups internally.
If you want to use Infinispan as CacheStore, please use JGroupsMessageChannel instead.

=== Cache Related

==== Redis's Unique Settings
If you want to receive notification of delete event issued when the key is deleted due to expiration based on the settings of cache lifespan(TimeToLive),
then you need to enable Redis' Keyspace notification feature.

Set it so to enable notification of Expired events via 'notify-keyspace-events' in redis.conf.
[source,caption="",title="Example: Enable all Keyspace notifications"]
----
notify-keyspace-events KEA
----
Because of Redis's feature, there is no guarantee that the notification was sent right when key deletion event triggers.
For further information about Keyspace features, please refer to link:https://redis.io/topics/notifications[Redis Keyspace Notifications^].

[[UpgradeToEnterpriseEdition]]
== Upgrading to Enterprise Edition
When upgrading to Enterprise Edition, it is necessary to replace Gradle projects and libraries, and also to add/replace additional tables.

The library and table DDL can be found from the Enterprise Edition SDK.

Either replace the Gradle or replace the library, please only do one of the two.

=== Replacing Gradle Project

Find the [iplass-ee-skeleton] from Enterprise Edition SDK, and use its [build.gradle] and [gradle.properties] to replace the file at current working directory.

Please open the replaced [gradle.properties], and fill [iPLAssMavenRepoUsername] and [iPLAssMavenRepoPassword] with the value of userName and password of Enterprise Edition Maven repository account.

=== Replacing Library

Replace the library under Community Edition by the corresponding library under the Enterprise Edition.
[cols="5,5",format="dsv",options="header",caption="",title="List of the Libraries to be Replaced",width="50%"]
|===
Community Edition:Enterprise Edition
iplass-core:iplass-ee-core

iplass-web:iplass-ee-web
iplass-admin:iplass-ee-admin
iplass-tools:iplass-ee-tools
iplass-tools-batch:iplass-ee-tools-batch※
|===

The library files are stored in the [lib] folder in the Enterprise Edition SDK. +
※For iplass-ee-tools-batch, it is in the [lib] folder of[iplass-ee-tools-batch-x.x.x.zip] which is included in the Enterprise Edition SDK.

=== Adding Additional Tables

Please execute the following DDL included in the Enterprise Edition SDK and create the tables.

- audit_log.sql
- sys_stats.sql
- t_available.sql

DDL files is located at [iplass-ee-server-setup-kit-x.x.x.zip] in the Enterprise Edition SDK and is categorized corresponding to different database types.

When using MySQL and and PostgreSQL with partitioning enabled, it is necessary to create additional partitions for [audit_log] table depends on the amount of current tenants.
To create additional partition, please use the partition management features from the tenant management tool: [<<../developerguide/support/index.adoc#tenantmanager,TenantManager>>]

[[Installer]]
== Installer
We will use the installer to set up the iPLAss environments.
The installer will create the iPLAss environments by specifying the necessary information with the interface or by the setting file.

=== Install methods
There are two ways to install. The user can install with our setup interface: [wizard installer]. The user can also install without such interface, instead they will have to fill the necessary information in the preset setting file and so to install the environment, which we denote by [silent install].

==== Wizard Install
This section we will instal via the setup interface.
The first time you access iPLAss deployed on the AP server, a wizard screen will be displayed.

.Procedure
. Access the iPLAss URL. +
Example: http(s)://<server name>:<port>/iplass
. Enter the necessary information on the setup screen and click the ``Start setup`` button.
. Restart the AP server according to the setup page.
. Access the iPLAss URL again.
. The "in preparation" page will show up, then it will redirect to the iPLAss login page.

Setup Page

.Setup Page Input Items(Connection information)
[cols="1,4a"]
|===
| Database | Select the database to use.
| DBA user name | Enter the user name of a user who has DBA privilege for the database.
| DBA password | Enter the password of the user with DBA privilege for the database.
| Binary data file store location | Enter the path of the root directory to save the binary data file.

| Automatic table creation 
| If checked, the table will be created for use in iPLAss. Be sure to check this box if you are setting up a new setup. +
If the table already exists, it will be recreated and the data will be initialized. +
Uncheck this checkbox if you wish to keep the existing data, e.g., for re-setup.

| JDBC URL 
| It will be set automatically when you enter the host name and port number. To edit directly, check "Edit". +
※ When using a database other than Oracle, be sure to set the DB name to "mtdb". +
 +
[NOTE]
====
Notes on using Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server::
TLS connections are enabled by default in 10.2 and later versions.
If you do not want to use TLS connection, you need to add `;encrypt=false` to the end of the JDBC URL.
To do so, you must check the "Edit" checkbox and edit the URL directly. +
+
.Example of JDBC URL Configuration
[source,text]
----
# If you do not use TLS connections with earlier than 10.2 versions.
jdbc:sqlserver://servername:1433;databaseName=mtdb

# If you do not use TLS connections with 10.2 or later versions.
jdbc:sqlserver://servername:1433;databaseName=mtdb;encrypt=false
----
====

| Host Name | Enter the host name or IP address of the database.
| Port Number | Enter the database port number. The default port number is automatically set when you select a database. +
※ If you changed the port number, enter the changed port number.
| Schema name/ Service name/ Database name | Enter only if the database is Oracle.
| User Name | Enter the user name that iPLAss will be using to access database.
| Password | Enter the password for the above User Name. +

.About the Administrator User Id and Password
TIP: User Id require at least 4 characters and can be composed by only [English characters and numbers] along with some special notation:[-] (minus) [@] [_] [.] (period). +
The password have to be at lease 6 characters.

==== Silent Install
By starting the AP server with the installation setting file specified, the installation will be performed automatically based on the specified installation setting file, without the install interface at all.

.Procedure
. Create <<InstallPropertiesFile>>.
. Modify the created install setting file corresponding to the environments.
. Place the created install setting file under the path of ``%USERPROFILE%/.iplass/`` and start the server with JVM option:``-Dmtp.install=＜install setting file path＞``.
. Access iPLAss URL.
. The "in preparation" page will show up, then it will redirect to the iPLAss login page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When placing the file under ``%USERPROFILE%/.iplass/``, the file name have to be ``install.properties``.
However,``mtp.install``command can specify any file names.
====

.Example with Tomcat
Assuming the created setting file is ``my-install.properties``, and we will specify it with JVM option``mtp.install``

. Create ``setenv.bat`` at ``%CATALINA_HOME%/bin`` directory
. In the created ``setenv.bat`` write the followings:
+
[source,bat]
----
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dmtp.install="＜install setting file path＞/my-install.properties"
----

TIP: If ``setenv.bat`` already exists, add the lines behind instead of overwriting.

[[installer_post_install_checklist]]
==== Post-Installation Checklist
After installation is complete, please verify the following items.

. <<installer_post_install_checklist_user_privilege>>

[[installer_post_install_checklist_user_privilege]]
===== Privilege for users created by the installer
The privilege for database users created by the installer are set in a simplified manner. +
When performing system operations, we recommend changing to the appropriate privileges.

=== iPLAss Home Directory
After setup is complete, the iPLAss home directory will be created. +
If the environment variable "IPLASS_HOME" is specified, that directory will be the iPLAss home directory. +
If not specified, `%USERPROFILE%/.iplass` will be the iPLAss home directory.

TIP: If you want to reset the installer and run the installation again, delete the iPLAss home directory.

Configuration files are stored under the iPLAss home directory. +
`iplass-service-config.xml` is the main configuration file that determines the behavior of iPLAss. +
For details about the configuration file, see <<../serviceconfig/index.adoc#, Configuration (service-config) References>>.

NOTE: The iplass-service-config.xml created by the installer has preprocessing enabled. When editing iplass-service-config.xml, you must escape `$` and `\` characters. +
For more information, see <<../serviceconfig/index.adoc#preprocess, Preprocessor>>.

=== Custom service-config
By specifying the custom service-config file to install, there will be no need to modify the service-config after the installation.

Usually, we will modify the generated ``iplass-service-config.xml`` under ``%USERPROFILE%/.iplass/`` after installation, to perform further configurations.
If we specify the service-config beforehand, we can save the works after  the installations.

In addition, you can specify or cancel the custom service-config after installation.

If the specified config file was canceled, the ``iplass-service-config.xml`` under ``%USERPROFILE%/.iplass/`` will be used instead.

==== Creating Custom service-config
Custom service-config have to inherit the ``/iplass-service-config.xml``.

Example: Assuming we want to configure about the default mail service for the tenant.
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE serviceDefinition>
<serviceDefinition>
  <inherits>/iplass-service-config.xml</inherits>

  <service>
    <interface>org.iplass.mtp.impl.core.TenantContextService</interface>

    <property name="defaultMailFrom" value="sample@sample.org" />
    <property name="defaultMailFromName" value="Sample" />
  </service>

</serviceDefinition>
----

==== Specifying Custom Service-Config
Custom service-config can be specified by JVM system property :``mtp.config.custom``.

Example：Assuming the Custom service-config is named``custom-service-config.xml``
[source,bat]
----
-Dmtp.config.custom="＜custom service-config file directory＞/custom-service-config.xml"
----

=== iPLAss version update
Please overwrite the existing installer file(war) with the latest version, regardless of the current status of the installation.

When upgrading to Enterprise Edition, in addition to overwriting the installer, please also perform the "Adding Additional Tables" process from "<<UpgradeToEnterpriseEdition,Upgrading to Enterprise Edition>>".
